This code is used to apply the SPH method to three common fluid setups


The memory file contains the parameters used for each set up.
to run each set up with out changing the code, comment/uncomment the
block definitions for the different problems in memory
there are a few options are each problem, aka if a variable smoothing length
is used or if viscosity is included. Please read how to use these in the memory.

There is also some saved splash setting for both the isothermal shock tube and
the sod shock tube. To use these firs run the code by

make clean
make
./run

splash snap* -p iso.

or

splash snap* -p sod.


they can then be plotted by using the saved multiplot settings 11
