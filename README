This code performs the following. 

1. Solves the equations of hydrodynamics using the one dimensional Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method.

2. Solves for the propagation of a one dimensional isothermal linear wave.

3. Solves the Sod shock tube problem and compares the results to the exact solution.


HOW TO USE:

The mem.f90 file contains the parameters used for each set up.
to run each set up with out changing the code, comment/uncomment the
problem block definitions for the different problems in mem.f90
there are a few options for each problem, aka if a variable smoothing length
is used or if viscosity is included. Please read how to use these in the mem.f90 file
ore instructions are listed

once that is set you can run the code using
make
./run 

STRUCTURE:
utils.f90
contains output and the setup routines

accel.f90
contains the acceleration, derivative of the kernal and the viscosity routines

density.f90
contains the density calculation and the kernal subroutine

derivs.f90
Is a subroutine that calls calculations with a variable or non varying smoothing length

eos.f90
contains the isothermal and adiabatic equations of sate

ghosts.f90
contains the subroutine for setting ghosts

step.f90
contains the time stepping routine

There aresaved splash settings for both the isothermal shock tube and
the sod shock tube. To use these first run the code by the following

make clean
make
./run

splash snap* -p iso.

or

splash snap* -p sod.


solutions can then be plotted by using the saved multiplot settings 11
